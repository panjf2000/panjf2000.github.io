## Who am I?

Hi there, I'm Andy Pan in English while `潘建锋` is how my Chinese name spells.

- 🇨🇳 Chinese
- 👔 Pronouns: "He" | "His"
- 🧑🏻‍💻 &nbsp;Programmer
- 🌏 Open-source software developer
- ⚡ Go, Java, Python, Rust ...

I started my programming career when I was in college by pitching into `C` initially. Later on,  I successively engaged in `Qt/C++`, `ASP.NET/C#`, `PHP/JS/HTML/CSS`, `Android/Java`, `Web/Python` and ultimately, `Go` stood out as my prime programming language and technology stack. Besides, I've recently become increasingly interested in `Rust` and have been studying it in depth.

I've created serveral [open-source software](https://taohuawu.club/my-github-repos), also made [minor contributions](https://github.com/panjf2000) to a few well-known open-source projects.

I'm currently a front-line programmer based in South China, mostly writing server-side code, and by the way, also a modern agnostic.
